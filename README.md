# hello-world
Running through the Git-Guide, lol.
Have just come off night shift and couldn't wind down, figured i'd finally take
a look at github! I want to start programmming, I've dabbled with HTML and a little Python
but that's it! I really want to learn HTML first, as I find it the easiest to understand.
